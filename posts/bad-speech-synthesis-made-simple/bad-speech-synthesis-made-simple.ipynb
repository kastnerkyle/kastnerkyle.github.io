    "There are a few key pieces to diphone unit selection synthesis, or at least the approach I took.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text to phoneme alignment\n",
    "2. Phoneme to diphone creation\n",
    "3. Audio lookup and stitching\n",
    "\n",
    "I will cover each of these steps in the following text, but first let's define some reference terms and discuss their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a phoneme?\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "A phoneme is considered an atomic unit of speech audio. Depending on which phoneset is used, there can be anywhere from 30-50+ phones, not counting inflection, accent and emotional variations. Recording all phonemes, or in our case diphone pairs, should make it possible (in theory, at least) to generate every word if we can manage to go effectively from text to phonemes and do good audio stitching. This approach can work quite well for English speech synthesis, but I think the approach is more difficult for other languages, especially ones with non Romance/Latin origins.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of two phonesets can be seen in the code directory, in the files ```cmu_phones.list``` and ```festival_phones.list```. Greater detail about phones and how they are defined can be found in the linked papers above, but for now just consider these to be atoms of speech sound - we will stitch combinations of these together in order to make sound for a given text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why not call two phonemes a biphone?\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "I had this exact same question - according to my friend João Felipe Santos it has to do with origin of the word \"phonemes\". The term phoneme comes from the study of [phonetics and phonology](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/PHONOLOGY1.htm) which was originally a [Greek term (and study)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics). Given that the Greek prefix for 2 is di- , rather the Latin bi- , we end up with the term \"diphone\" instead [(ref)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_prefix).\n",

    "To begin our adventure, we can imagine wanting a tool that takes normal, human understandable words and sentences, and \n",
    "converts them into a series of sounds (phonemes) that would make sense. This task is complicated, and has many possible approaches. However, one of the most straightforward approaches is to use something called a pronunciation dictionary to look up which phonemes you need to pronounce each word. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of pronunciation dictionaries but one of the biggest/most complete dictionaries I have found is used by [CMU Sphinx](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/), an open source speech recognition toolkit. Sidenote - if you are interested in recognition, I have made an \"all-in-one\" wrapper to a light version of Sphinx, called pocketsphinx. You can find that code here https://github.com/kastnerkyle/ez-phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing on our path for synthesis, we now have a human crafted lookup table to go from words to sounds. Unfortunately, we almost immediately run into a common problem in sequential modeling - the length of the text and the length of the pronunciation/phoneme sequence are not the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "This normally requires somewhat complicated machine learning techniques, in order to learn a valid alignment and predict it. However in the papers I listed above (such as [Letter to Sound Rules For Accented Lexicon Compression, Pagel, Lenzo, Black](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/papers/ICSLP98-lts.pdf)) the authors describe a fairly straightforward dynamic programming algorithm for inputting a new character (\"\\_\") in the predicted sequence which makes the mapping from text to extended phones 1:1. This makes the machine learning portion of this system much simpler.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in the original CMU dict we have lines such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "BEATNIK B IY T N IH K\n",
    "```\n",

You can also try your own custom dictionary - I included copies of the relevant t2p scripts as well. Processing the alignments for this dictionary took about 10 minutes on my machine (Macbook Air 2011)."

    "After reading the [Pixel RNN paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759) and reviewing the [Deep Learning book (Figure 10.4 and section 10.2.1)](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html#pf9), I have become interested in trying to train sequential decision models in parallel, using teacher forced (ground truth) data as a proxy for the sequential predictions. This means you can train in parallel, but apply recursively at test time to still get a sequential decision. A fully bidirection approach to this can be seen in  [Natural Language Processing From Scratch, Collobert, Weston, Bouttou, Karlen, Kavukcuoglu, Kuksa](http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0398), but for now we will use a \"left-to-right\" approach since I find it easier to understand and work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this new fascination I added one extra wrinkle using \"Markov features\" (for lack of a better name) to make features modeling $p(y_i\\>|\\>x_{i-n/2} ... x_{i+n/2}, y_{i-1})$. Due to adding a $y_{i-1}$ feature, the phone sequence to predict was padded in front with one \"SIL\" phoneme at the very start, allong the decision tree to \"learn to start\". After making all the ngram + Markov features, there end up being ~900,000 samples generated from the original 138,000 aligned sequences. After this processing, the final features looked like the below example (remember, last entry is the target to predict). This is our training data for the classification algorithm which will map text to phonemes.\n",

Either way, it is something I hope to explore further another time.\n",

    "===============================\n",
    "I will not review the decision tree learning algorithm in depth, but most of my implementation is derived from [Kevin Davenport](http://kldavenport.com/pure-python-decision-trees/) and [Patrick L. Le](http://www.patricklamle.com/Tutorials/Decision%20tree%20python/tuto_decision%20tree.html), who in turn derived from [Programming Collective Intelligence, Toby Segaran](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do). The primary reason I chose a pure Python approach, rather than using the (much superior) implementation in [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier) is so that I could serialize the tree once and save it in this repo, not worrying about possible API changes in future versions of sklearn. I was also curious how to serialize Python objects in pure json, so this was a nice experiment for that although jsonpickle seems a more robust and general solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, decision tree learning tries to split the data along every column (in my implementation, by trying each split). Testing the resulting 2 datasets for \"purity\", measured by the entropy of the labels in each half, our goal is to find splits where all the labels are the same in one of the halves. Choosing the candidate split which was the most pure, we recusively apply the same logic in each half until we reach splits with entropy 0, meaning all the labels in this split are the same - sometimes phrased as \"the leaf is pure\". This means that as long as there is valid 1:1 mapping in the feature set (the same set of features don't map to 2 different labels), a deep enough decision tree will be *perfect* on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally this may seem like a bad thing, since it means decision trees are easy to overfit (leading to algorithms like random forests, boosted trees, and so on which try to regularize the power of the tree) but in this context it is actually great - it means that we can put words we want to pronounce correctly in the training set, and the decision tree should be able to perfectly pronounce them. This makes the system easy to modify and extend, not to mention the fact that decision tree rules are easy to visualize (see the previous links) and potentially modify by hand using expert analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using my own implementation of the decision tree means the algorithm does not scale particularly well (though good implementations are quite scalable). We are only able to train on around 10,000 examples out of the potential ***900,000*** available, and I am sure adding more training data would greatly boost performance. On the other hand, if the results were too good I couldn't title this article \"Bad Speech Synthesis\"."

One of the biggest questions I have is if this \"backward continuation\" in 1a makes sense.
